The Transformer model uses soft attention with softmax. If we could instead use linear attention (which can be converted into an RNN that uses fast weights), we could use the resulting model for RL. Specifically, an RL rollout with a transformer over a huge context would be impractical, but running an RNN with fast weights would be very feasible. Your goal: take any language modeling task; train a transformer; then find a way to get the same bits per character/word using a linear-attention transformer with different hyperparameters, without increasing the total number of parameters by much. Only one caveat: this may turn out to be impossible. But one potentially helpful hint: it is likely that transformers with linear attention require much higher dimensional key/value vectors compared to attention that uses the softmax, which can be done without significantly increasing the number of parameters.
